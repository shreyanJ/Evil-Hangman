# Evil-Hangman
This is a game created for my high school Data Structures course, in Java. A version of Hangman in which the computer "cheats" by keeping track of all possible words at a given stage, rather than choosing a single word at the beginning of the game (making it nearly impossible for the player to guess the word).
